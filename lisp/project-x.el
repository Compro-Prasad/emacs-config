;;; COMMENTARY:
;;;
;;; Some convenience features for project.el:
;;; - Recognize any directory with a `.project' file as a project.
;;; - Save and restore project files and window configurations across sessions
;;;
;;; COMMANDS:
;;;
;;; project-window-state-save : Save the window configuration of currently open project buffers
;;; project-window-state-load : Load a previously saved project window configuration
;;;
;;; CUSTOMIZATION:
;;;
;;; `project-window-list-file': File to store project window configurations
;;; `project-local-identifier': String matched against file names to decide if a
;;;                             directory is a project
;;;
